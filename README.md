<h1>Tableau Project: Health Factors - Physical Activity's Effects on Sleep and Blood Pressure

 </h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project analyzes health data from patients aged 18 and older to explore the relationship between physical activity, sleep quality, and blood pressure. The study examines correlations between exercise duration, average daily step count, and their impact on key health metrics. Additionally, it evaluates how these factors vary based on Body Mass Index (BMI) and the presence of sleep disorders, assessing their influence on overall sleep quality and average blood pressure. All patient data was de-identified and handled in compliance with HIPAA regulations to ensure privacy and confidentiality.
